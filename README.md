This is where all the code for our website is going to be placed.  

You can use the Replit IDE to edit this, however the link has been removed due to security issues.

The link to the actual website is [here](javajokers.github.io)

Hey Eli and Henry, the other repl was funky with the branches, and so I created a new one.  You should have it on you repl.
