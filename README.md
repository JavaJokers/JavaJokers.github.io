This is where all the code for our website is going to be placed.  

I found some CSS templates here [Free CSS](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates) and a couple here [W3Schools Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_templates.asp)

Please browse through the templates and let me know which one you like @rpmm24

You can use the Replit IDE to edit this at [JavaJokers.github.io](https://replit.com/join/dqcbvpdkny-sam948byte)
